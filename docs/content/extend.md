## Extending Annotation Types

The underlying code for d3-annotation is very extensible. There is a base annotation type that all of the annotation types extend. All of the settings and components that make up the different types are customizable. 

The goal here was to make a system that was easy to adapt to your requirements. A longer post with details about how you can make your own customized type will be coming out in a couple of weeks. 

If you're interested in looking at the structure before the post is out take a look at the [source code](https://github.com/susielu/d3-annotation/tree/master/src).
