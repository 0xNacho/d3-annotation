## Introduction
Can you imagine Google Maps without any city labels, street names, highway badges? Then why are annotations so few and far between in visualizations on the web? 

**Implementing annotations is difficult.**

d3-annotation is made for [d3-v4](https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/master/CHANGES.md) and **only** supports SVG annotations, the plan is to also make them accessible in canvas.

Let's break down the barrier that limits our ability to **establish context, and direct users to insights and anomalies**.

I would love your help in making more annotation types and layout algorithms.
