## Setup

### Include the file directly

You must include the [d3 library](http://d3js.org/) before including the annotation file. Then you can add the compiled js file to your website

- [All annotations](https://github.com/susielu/d3-annotation/blob/master/d3-annotation.js)
- TODO: create minified version

### Using NPM

You can add d3-annotation as a node module by running

<pre><code>npm i d3-svg-annotation -S</code></pre>
